# Network-Load-Balancer-Simulation

Course project for [CSCD58: Computer Networks](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscd58h3)

## Project Description

* **Motivation:** Load balancing is a key part to building low latency, highly available systems of the 21st century. Big companies such as google have even implemented [load balancers](https://research.google/pubs/pub44824/) directly integrated with ISP architectures 
* This project uses [Mininet](https://github.com/mininet/mininet) and creates SDN (software defined network) topologies
